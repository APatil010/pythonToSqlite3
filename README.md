# Python To SQLite3

Just a simple conversion tool, I made because my friends were doing some hard and labour work of adding questions and answers of a specific format in their sqlite3 database, so just had the idea for reading all the questions from a text file and writing all the questions into the database.

## Things used:
   SQLite3
   ,python
   ,File handling in python
